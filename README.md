This project was created as the final project for my Applications of Embedded Systems course. For this project, we built an interactive circuits game, targetted for beginners who are learning the basics of circuit building and analysis. To play the game, the player will be tasked with building a circuits on a breadboard under a time constraint. Based on the ADC readings at certain nodes in the circuit, we built firmware to determine whether the circuit was built correctly. The difficulty of the levels increases as the player successfully completes each circuit. We used an LCD display to show the user the time he or she has remaining to complete the circuit, and interfaced to a tablet GUI via bluetooth to provide additional learning visuals and control.
